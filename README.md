# expanding-cards

## Description
A small interactive project where multiple cards are displayed on the screen. When you click a card, it expands to show more content, and any previously expanded card shrinks back. This demonstrates dynamic UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features  
- Responsive design that looks good on desktop and mobile
